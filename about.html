                Karen is a former women’s semi-professional baseball player. It was exactly like the movie. “A League of Their Own.” She was able to travel in tournaments throughout the U.S. and Canada. She even autographed a baseball that is in the Stan Musial Museum in Michigan. She had a once-in-a-lifetime experience playing on professional baseball fields and being coached by Wade Boggs and Barbaro Garby from the Detroit Tigers.<br><br> 

                Karen’s love for students and their education, as well as their educational future are what drives her to help them become successful on their educational journeys. Karen loves horse racing, dogs, tiny homes, baseball, and travel.</p>

              Kenn has given his life to work that invests in the well-being of people and their communities. His hope is to see all people and every community flourishing and because of this, he has often taken on roles that allow him to care for the vulnerable and those that are often overlooked. Much of his work has focused on empowering young people to discover their dreams and then help them to find the best opportunities for them to pursue their goals.  He has served his community as Campus Minister, Community Development Worker, Mentor, Life Coach, Community Educator, Adjunct Professor, Family Advocate, Good Works Catalyst, Neighbor, Father, Husband, and Friend.<br><br> 

              Kenn is excited to be a part of EMP and the ICP-Teams Family helping to prepare young people not only for college but to help them to become adults who will create a better world for everyone. He loves to explore new places, bike, hike, and spend time with his family.</p>

                Richard graduated from Texas Tech University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Exercise and Sport Sciences and a Masters of Education at St. Lawrence University. He has experienced a successful and diverse career as an instructor, coach (up through collegiate levels), administrator and now as an entrepreneur. Richard’s simple, yet innovative messaging-only platform (transParentSee) was the perfect fit for ICP-TEAMS. His mission to include parents in real-time conversations between educators and students is critical to ensuring a student’s success.<br><br>
                By partnering with transParentSee, and their innovative 3-Level Engagement design, our students and parents have direct access to our team. This direct access helps eliminate possibilities for essential information to get lost in an email or on the student portal. Educators, students, and parents are included in all conversations in real-time. Students and parents will not have to worry about missing important events, registration deadlines, and scholarship opportunities, all of this  is relevant information needed to make decisions that will impact student’s futures.<br><br> 

                We know from experience that ongoing, clear communication is vitally important when keeping both students and families informed of the student’s progress. The ICP-TEAMS Educational Management Program provides guidance and support to students and encourages parental involvement prior to students making lifetime educational decisions. Meg’s selection of the transParentSee platform has resulted in a more user-friendly program with increased parental oversite. We believe consistent and transparent communication is a profound piece of the education puzzle and transParentSee is an important catalyst in helping students exceed educational goals.</p>
